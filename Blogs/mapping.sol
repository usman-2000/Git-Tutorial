A data type that helps us to map keys with values.
It is more likely to dictionary in the python language.

mapping(uint=>string) public student;

why we don't use arrays instead of mapping?

because in arrays we need indexes to get or set a value. We can only set values in order. Like if a student has  a roll number of 1001, than in arrays we should assign empty spaces before 1001. But in mapping we simply assign the key and it returns tha value whenever need.
